         <h1>Staff</h1>
         <p>All of our staff members hold Wilderness First Responder certifications and
            have completed courses with the American Mountain Guide Association (AMGA).  
            While the training and certifications of our staff are nice, what we 
            really take pride in at Cliff Hangers is the quality of our
            instructors.  Many climbing schools will guide clients up cliffs 
            but at Cliff Hangers we put an emphasis on teaching you the skills 
            you need to enjoy this sport safely on your own without constant
            professional guiding.  To ensure our staff is able to do this, we 
            hire only instructors who have a love of teaching as well as a love for climbing.
