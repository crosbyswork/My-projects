         <h1>Climbing Lessons</h1>

         <p>Here at Cliff Hangers we provide several levels of climbing instruction, 
            all tailored to your individual strengths, interests, and comfort levels. 
            You can start your lessons on small one- and two-pitch climbs and move up to longer
            routes. We cover everything from working with hand- and footholds to working
            with ice axes. Lessons are always under the watchful and encouraging eye
            of an experienced instructor. Special instruction is also available for 
            those with special physical needs or requirements.
         </p>
         <p>NOTE: Students may be removed from the courses for safety reasons at any 
            time based on the discretion of the instructor. Partial refunds available
            for any uncompleted courses.
