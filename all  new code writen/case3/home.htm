         <p class="intro">Welcome to one of America's best climbing schools, located in one of 
            America's best climbing areas &mdash; the Colorado Rockies. Nowhere else in 
            America is there such a rich variety of technically 
            challenging rock, ice, and high alpine routes. The area presents the 
            climber with a choice of multiple-pitch climbs and big wall routes. Whether 
            you are here to enjoy the spectacular scenery or to train for an expedition, 
            you can choose no better place than the Colorado Front Range.
         </p>

            Cliff Hangers Climbing School. Whether you are a beginner itching to 
            learn the skill and art of
