         <h1>Tours</h1>
         <p>Let Cliff Hangers take you to places you have never been before. 
            Our professionally trained guides get you there and teach you 
            the sports of rock climbing, ice climbing, and extreme climbing
            that you may have only read about in adventure magazines.
            Our friendly climbing guides provide the fun in a safe and exciting 
            environment for all levels of climbers. Even if you are new to the 
            sport, we have tours and tour guides for you.
         </p>
         <p>Our tours can be booked as standalone outings, or you can pair them
            with courses from our climbing school at a reduced cost. Please view
            the list of tours below.
         </p>


         <h2 id="ec">Eldorado Canyon</h2>
         <figure>
            <img src="eldorado.png" alt="" />
         </figure>
         <p>Eldorado Canyon is not actually in Rocky Mountain National Park, but if you're 
            willing to take a 60-minute drive to this awesome state park, we can provide 
            some of the best climbing in Colorado. Choose from beginner climbs to more 
            advanced routes. Eldorado offers climbs of 400 to 600 feet high on a solid
            rock wall. All climbs are only a short distance from the parking lot.
            No matter what your skill and experience, we'll tailor the Eldorado
            Canyon tour to fit you.
         </p>

         <figure>
            <img src="grepon.png" alt="" />
         </figure>
         <p>Nestled in the middle of the Cathedral Spires, the Petit Grepon is one of Rocky 
            Mountain National Park's most challenging and awesome climbs. The summit of 
            the peak is a mere ten- by thirty-foot perch, so don't plan on group photos from
            the top. For those who are more interested 
            in a less intimidating climb, we also offer tours up Sharkstooth, a nearby summit 
            offering excellent views of the Petit Grepon.

         <figure>
            <img src="diamond.png" alt="" />
         </figure>
         <p>The pinnacle of climbing in Rocky Mountain National Park, the Diamond starts at 
            13,100 feet and rises nearly 1000 vertical feet to the upper slopes of Longs Peak.
            The left side of the Diamond offers several different routes, none easier 
            than 5.10 (extreme difficulty). The right half of the Diamond is primarily
            used by aid climbers. Due to the strenuous nature of the Diamond, all participants
            will have to pass a physical examination and climbing evaluation.

         <h2 id="kr">Longs Peak: Kiener's Route</h2>
         <figure>
            <img src="kieners.png" alt="" />
         </figure>
         <p>One of the most awesome climbs in the park, yet still very accessible to
            the beginning climber, Kiener's Route is a Cliff Hangers favorite. The
            route starts at Mills Glacier and proceeds up a 1000-foot couloir known
            as Lamb's Slide (ice axes and crampons required). Moving
            off Lamb's Slide, you are led across Broadway, a narrow ledge varying in
            width from several feet to six inches. The ledge overlooks a sheet of 
            granite plunging down to Chasm Lake far below.
            Proceeding up from Broadway, you will climb to the summit of Longs Peak 
            following a route requiring climbing gear and climbing technique. Kiener's 
            is one of North America's classic climbs.

         <h2 id="nf">Longs Peak: The North Face</h2>
         <figure>
            <img src="nface.png" alt="" />
         </figure>
         <p>The North Face route of Longs Peak is the perfect tour for the beginning
            climber who wants to reach the summit following a different route from 
            the main trail. The North Face is the most direct and shortest route and does 
            not have the crowds you'll find in the more popular Keyhole route. The views 
            from the North Face are spectacular and provide some of the finest scenery in 
            the park.

         <figure>
            <img src="lumpy.png" alt="" />
         </figure>
         <p>Located north of Estes Park, Lumpy Ridge is a veritable garden of interesting and
            challenging routes for climbers of all ages and abilities. Lumpy Ridge is
            a three-mile-long granite ridge containing over 400 different climbing
            routes with names ranging from the "Bowels of the Owls" to the "J Crack."
            Guides from Cliff Hangers will be happy to lead you and your party
            to some of the most sought-after climbing routes in the country.
